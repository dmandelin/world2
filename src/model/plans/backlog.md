## Original settlement

- Start out people as semi-nomadic

## Learning and status

### Discussion

- There are potentially a few factors to track:
  - How much we can learn from other clan
  - How much other clan can punish or reward us
  - How much we expect they'll help or hurt us
  - Relatedness: how much helping them helps us

- For now we want to focus on culture and learning, so
  how much can we learn is the relevant thing. We'll
  call that prestige.
  - We can pretty much make up the metric
  - Then people will adjust their beliefs and behavior
    to be more like the prestige-weighted average

- What stuff we adjust:
  - Farming knowledge/skill
  - Ritual knowledge/lore
  - At first, we could have just a single knowledge score
    - Knowledge can grow or decay over the generations
    - Clan size, intelligence, and information storage
      systems determine a maximum knowledge level
    - Knowledge can be randomly gained or lost

- Prestige depends on what clans know about each other
  - Note that although clans in a settlement are all up
    in each others' business, this doesn't mean they 
    know everything!
    - In particular, they'll learn about a subset of
      events, but keep in mind they don't have measurement
      and recording systems, so knowledge will be a lot
      more spotty

- Society features
  - Whenever parameters depend on features of our society
    that will change in the future, we should add those as
    nominally changeable society features, to help fill
    out that idea.
