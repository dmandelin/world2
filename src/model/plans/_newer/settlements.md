In the latest update, the shift to permanent settlements will be the
first major change, with the initial three shifts feeding into it and
supporting it.

Permanence will be emergent, with these actual changes occurring:

*   Increasing use and time of habitation:
    *   work site
    *   site of socializing, gossip, and buzz
    *   site of birth and child care
    *   percentage of time spent there (discrete or continuous)
    *   (possibly later) unbuilt major ceremonial site, e.g., village center
    *   (later) built ceremonial site or amenity
*   Tell growth:
    *   tells grew by about 2m/millennium = 4cm/turn
    *   tell volume then gives history of habitation

We could model the usage spectrum in lots of different ways, here's
one cut at it:

*   Clans start using the farm area as a work site, with some
    % of time there
*   They can add other uses (note also more disease for more use):
    *   Visit: get more information, maybe some cooperation benefit
        amenity for gossip and favors
    *   Births: effects of stationariness on birth rate (noting that
        flood control quality is important here), more information,
        more cooperation benefit. Amenity for help for mothers
    *   Stay: living there whenever not out foraging, more effects
        *   Optionally, after 3-4 turns of this, people use a word
            for that place that also means "home" to them

We'll want some announcements and/or map icons to show the changing
usage and the arrival of change in each area. 

Ditching is critical to permanence, because otherwise rivers shift
and the houses and/or farms need to move. There could be some sites
(definitely in other regions) where it's easier to settle.

How the other changes work with this:

*   Increased farming
    *   Population pressure will naturally prompt this, which means
        increasing work time in the settlement
    *   Staying really only makes sense if there is sufficient cereal
        storage, so we'll have to model this. Not allowing people to
        be in the farm more than their farm % of food intake could
        work; we should probably also allow 25% grace for off season
        and to help them get to what we would generally call permanent
        residence.
    *   Farming is more productive when people can be more stationary.
*   Better shelter
    *   Should make spending more time there more appealing; shelter
        benefit could be proportional to time spent there
    *   More expensive houses mostly only make sense if people can avoid
        shifting around more.
*   Clay art
    *   Seems like it could be carried around by mobile foragers, but
        it's probably not a great fit, as potentially heavy and fragile.
        I'll assume it requires stationarity.
    *   This could help support farming morale to help going along with
        increased farming.
