Notes on happiness. It replaces/modifies the relatively complicated
QoL model, so it's harder to deal with piecemeal.

## General concepts

### Defining happiness

Many definitions of happiness have been used that could be relevant.

*   Modern research
    *   Cantril scale: self-reated 0-10 worst-best possible life
        Basically subjective life quality/satisfaction/well-being
    *   Other surveys measure happiness as a current emotion. This
        in general seems to correlate less with anything else.
*   Ancient and traditional thought
    *   It seems that in communal societies, people's individual
        sense of well-being really does depend a lot on communal
        well-being and connection, including to/with ancestors
        and powerful beings.
    *   Some collective societies have more rules and roles, and
        happiness is seen as tied to performing them well and
        maintaing social order. There also may be a sense of virtue
        connected with more prestigious roles.

Something like the Cantril scale with ancient values could work.

### Community vs clan factors

Due to both communal ideals and spillover effects, clan happiness
could be influenced by any or all of:

*   Clan conditions
*   Neighbor relations
*   Neighbor and community conditions
*   Neighbor and community happiness

### The hedonic treadmill

Research finds factors that correlate with happiness, but also that
people's expectations change and many things affect long-term
happiness surprisingly little. Attempting to resolve the paradox:

*   Happiness as positive emotion this minute is relatively fleeting,
    with good or bad conditions soon becoming expected.
*   Most factors influencing happiness are either social or health,
    which I posit don't adjust and become background that much; it's
    more the consumption components that do that.
*   Ancient conceptions of happiness were more "objective", so it may
    be reasonable to treat things that way.

Overall, it seems reasonable to key on a life satisfaction scale,
keeping in mind that:

*   It's not representing moment-to-moment emotion
*   We could later adjust certain aspects for expectations if we wanted

## Factors influencing happiness

Synthesizing some stuff, key general factors are:

*   Health: mental and physical
*   Relationships: marriage, friendships, community
*   Employment: for income, but also purpose, identity, and social connection
*   Society: freedom, fairness, generosity, religion
*   Innate: genetics and personality

### Modeling discussion

In modern times, income is an important factor but not the most important.
But in prehistory, income would much more directly convert to health, which
is very important. We can handle this either by making health a factor, or
by emphasizing "needs" consumption.

Relationships are about assistance, but also fellowship, safety, marriages,
and so on. This could correspond to alignment in the model, but that submodel
isn't that well-developed yet, so not much would hang off of it.

Employment may split off into income (if separate from health) and prestige.

Society could include things like:

*   Generosity as in temple redistribution to widows and orphans
*   Sense of order as embodied in ritual, architecture, and peace
*   Perception of fairness
*   Acceptance of current arrangements

### Modeling notes

Stuff going with the current model:

*   Health and comfort
    *   Calculate a health value corresponding to the current birth/death
        rate adjusters
    *   Use that plus disease mortality and flood casualties to get a 
        happiness component
    *   Maybe also include moving discomfort here, but could be its own
*   Community
    *   Good or bad relations with neighbors. These should probably have
        some material benefits too to health and productivity.
    *   Village rituals
*   Prestige
    *   Prestige granted by neighbors
    *   Prestige goods

That's similar to the current QoL model after all, though we will want
a treadmill for luxury consumption at some point. Otherwise, the lessons
are that social factors should be big (and in fact perhaps personal
wealth mainly matters if in a society where it matters) and that a single
scale seems to hold up.

The one thing from the QoL model not listed above is crowding: we still
need some incentive for villages to fission. There are at least two main
tacks that could be taken:

*   General evaluation of society
    *   It seems that in some societies, once a settlement gets too big,
        it doesn't have the characteristics people want.
    *   Simplest version: direct disamenity for population
    *   Next: model how much people know and trust each other, and key
        on that. Can also have some other minuses like commuting and
        ritual overcrowding.
    *   How settlements can get bigger
        *   Simplest version: urban amenities and culture changes counter
            disamenity
        *   Next:
            *   Neighborhoods can allow for good neighbor relations in
                smaller scope
            *   Still need something to connect community overall, such
                as urban amenities, but rituals more than that
            *   Could also have prestige for living in a settlement, which
                then becomes an amenity
*   Specific conflicts
    *   It seems villages can also fission because of specific conflicts
        between groups in the village
    *   This one seems tricky as we don't have much narrative components
        yet and not much clear way to model this
    *   Conflict over named issues and unnamed local conflicts both seem
        possible

It's probably best to keep things simple for now, and elaborate as much as
needed for current modeling goals.
