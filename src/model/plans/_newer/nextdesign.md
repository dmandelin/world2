Detailed design on next stuff

*   Key focus areas right now:
    *   Get clans interacting with each other and having reactions to
        each other
    *   UI focus on clans as much as needed to give the detail to
        understand their situations
    *   News/chronicle to better understand events and progression

*   Marriage
    x   Seed initial marriages
    x   Fix: reduce neighbor alignment a bit so that it's smaller than
        close marriage alliances
    *   Clans A and B marrying:
        x   Increases alignment to each other
        *   Raises or lowers each other's prestige to be more similar
            x   Introduce new respect concept to give something to hang
                this off of
            *   Add tooltips to respect crosstab
                x   Tooltips for cells
                *   Tooltips for aggregate row
            *   Introduce communication to update respect dependent on
                relationships and proximity
        *   Blends attributes and skills too
        *   Increases knowledge of each other (and impact on prestige)
        *   Increases ability to imitate each other
        *   Optional: regular gift exchange

*   Favor exchange relationships
    *   Benefits from exchange with neighbors and family

*   Feasts and gifts
    *   The key point on this for now is that we want clans that are
        more productive to boost their prestige so other clans are
        more likely to imitate them
    *   Simple model
        *   Clans can throw basic or lavish feasts.
            *   Or different levels
        *   Effects
            *   Cost food and/or labor per attendee
                *   Eventually gets too big to invite everyone
            *   Transfer some fraction of food resources
            *   +prestige (even if just heard about)
            *   +alignment
            *   +happiness for everyone

*   Somewhere around this point we also need to do mutual aid.
    *   There can be a routine version where connections give various
        bonuses
        *   +production
        *   +health
    *   Also crisis version of helping through big losses
        *   ~once a turn a clan experiences a crop failure or something
            big like that
        *   aligned clans more likely to help

*   Rituals, omens, and healing
    *   Key points here are:
        *   People in prominent roles see their prestige change more, especially
            based on results
        *   Major omens and events also increase prestige changes based on 
            results
        *   Larger scale causes issues and benefits:
            *   Participatory rituals less effective
            *   Consensus elections less effective
            *   More disagreement/less customization in content
            *   Leadership and leader skill more important
            *   More impressive
    *   Ritual leaders
        *   Start with 1 office per clan
        *   Office effects:
            *   ritual quality according to officer abilities
                *   +happiness for everyone
                *   impact much larger at bigger scales
                *   at some point size tanks quality unless structure changes
            *   +prestige
            *   +alignment
        *   Select by:
            *   merit: various factors but around prestige, quality
            *   egalitarianism: penalty if already has more offices
            *   alignment: initial potential for conflict
        *   Initially consensus - big penalties if failing to reach it
    *   Major omens and crises
        *   ~once per turn there is a major omen or crisis prompting
            a response
        *   Basic ritual leaders are coordinators so they don't necessarily
            have to respond, but if there are experts, they're expected to
        *   Someone might initiate a change (increase in ritual elaboration)
            *   If the later result is good, it can be retained, and +prestige
                for the innovator
            *   If the later result is bad, -prestige for the innovator

*   Trade
    *   At some point should add the needed flint trade based on these
        relationships

*   Benefits of prestige
    *   What we have for now is OK but here are more ideas
    *   Possibility of larger share in communal distributions
        (e.g., offered best meat at feast), even in relatively
        egalitarian situations
    *   Easier to get help when needed
    *   Easier to transmit ideas and practices
    *   Marriage desirability
        *   Note that this one is recursive because the point is to
            marry a family with prestige -- this doesn't ground
