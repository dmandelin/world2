**Interactions** covers ways clans can affect each other, but we
could use some better ideas on relationships, including:

*   Clans' channels for interacting with each other: whom can they
    interact with, in what ways, with what density?
*   Clans' basic knowledge about each other
*   Clans' evaluations of each other

This can get very complicated very fast, so let's start with a
narrow slice: marriage and economic production. We need to consider
factors such as:

*   Finding marriage partners
*   Closer alignment of clans following marriages
*   Clans' knowledge of each other
*   Needing local neighbors for small-scale trade and mutual help
*   Clans learning skills and decisions from each other

## Initial discussion

We can have dyadic relationships but also group ones. Clans in the
same village or neighborhood can have a "neighbors" relationship
which enables them to know about each other and interact. We also
already have family relationships: parent-cadet and marriage. In
that case, they can interact across some distance, but that would
have some cost and reduce how they can interact.

So what really ties different villages together? Family relationships
will tend to do that, as people can marry outside their villages, but
there's a bit of a gap here, as we simply artificially allow that in
our small scale. Maybe we don't have to worry that much about larger
scale until we get there, but we should still have some notion what's
going on here.

In general, we can imagine that nearby villages at the start often
interact for marriages and family visits, small-scale trade, and
certain gatherings such as festivals and trade fairs.

-   We should prime family relationships so some exist at the start.
    It's a little weird to start with zero relationships. That will
    give at least some links.
-   We can then let people marry any neighbors of anyone they have
    relationships with. That will justify their ability to marry as
    they currently do.

Next, let's think about clans' needs for local connections for
economic production. Each clan is nominally a self-sufficient
productive operation, but in practice it seems people did a lot
better when they had some friendly neighbors. There are a few
different effects we can think about:

*   Local specialization. We can imagine that there are various
    subskills and no one is great at them all. So there can be a
    production bonus with neighbors, with diminishing returns.
    *   This works better when relations with the neighbors are
        better.
        TODO - think about what that means in more detail
*   Infrastructure and support. A big one would be insurance against
    various misfortunes, to provide extra help when needed, etc.
    There are lots of ways this could be modeled, but perhaps we
    can start by assuming some generic cultural version of this,
    with new, more specialized forms to be added over time, which
    can also be used to help detail the original idea.
    *   Local specialization could even be considered a subset of
        this.

Now, when calling for help, there are a few different ways it can
go:

*   Ask for help with no offer of compensation
    *   Examples: asking relatives, widows calling on rulers
    *   We can imagine this isn't the main kind of help, but that
        it does exist
    *   Unclear whether related clans go under this, because it
        seems usually there is some expectation
    *   A key form might be getting help from the entire nearby
        village, but that might actually be mutual insurance
    *   Basically depends on relatedness or other such factor to
        create an incentive
*   Ongoing mutual assistance relationship
    *   A group could have an ongoing relationship where all agree
        to aid each as need
    *   Has some cost to members to maintain the relationship, e.g.,
        to meet and exchange stuff to keep the relationship going
    *   People might refuse to supply aid if helping would somehow
        be bad (clan needing help is hostile, or shirks)
    *   People might also supply more or less aid depending on
        relationship
*   Credit system
    *   A clan can ask for a favor, so that another clan has a debt
        claim on them
    *   If favor debts stack up, the lender will expect the debtor
        to provide "stuff" other than favors, e.g., gifts, service,
        political support
    *   With 20-year turns, we might mostly want all these to clear
        within the turn, so that it's an exchange, but we could think
        about longer relationships too
    *   People tend to want to do a favor on credit only if the
        borrower is non-hostile, can repay, and will
*   Subordination
    *   A clan can place itself in a subordinate position in return
        for favors
    *   This is a more permanent relationship

At the beginning, we probably have some of each of the first three.
Let's see if we can make it more defined than a ball of mush:

*   Generosity: Let's say that villages have a practice where if
    someone is wiped out by disaster, the whole village will chip
    in to help them out, without expecting specific repayment.
    "Catastrophe insurance"

*   Mutuality: Let's say there's a lot of everyday village cooperation
    that provides some scaling benefits to production and maybe other
    things. This is also a specific village practice that could be
    replaced later.
    "Quotidian cooperation"

*   Credit: Let's say that at first this comes into play for special
    situations: something less than a disaster, but more than the
    everyday and traditional. At the very beginning, we could even
    let this category be empty, but things will probably come into
    play soon enough. We can think about needs such as:
    *   Help building a new kind of house or ditch. There might be
        traditional practices that provide for generosity or mutuality
        in building standard buildings, but maybe innovation calls for
        special favors
    *   Providing special goods or services for a feast, or attending
        special feasts
    *   Access to special trade goods
    *   Help resolving an especially hard dispute
    *   Help with a local political issue
    *   Help with sickness or some other special misfortune. The
        lender could be a specialist, or even the gods, so that
        the borrow repays via sacrifice, founding a temple, etc
    To keep this simple at first, we could center it on "special needs",
    which could be sickness, issues finding a spouse, or an intra-clan
    conflict.
