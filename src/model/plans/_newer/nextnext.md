## Thinking through next piece

Some interrelated items are toward the top of the list:

-   Give clans ways to interact more so they can learn skills from
    each other faster
-   Let clans learn from each other to farm more
    -   Also show recent changes in labor allocation
-   Boost prestige of consumption so it influences imitation
-   Make prestige UI more comprehensible

Initial discussion: Let's think about this narratively for a bit.
We can imagine some farmers who might imitate each other in different
kinds of things:

*   Simple decisions: what day to plant, how much to farm vs fish.
    They can imitate each other with a low amount of information
    and and a low amount of effort.
*   Simple techniques: a new tool or a new way of using one. It takes
    a bit more information to imitate, although the information may
    be conveniently in the form of a new tool. It also make take some
    effort to master the new technique, but not a long time.
*   Difficult techniques: some techniques may take a decade or a
    lifetime to master.

For simple decisions, ordinary gossip would be enough to carry the
information. And if everyone is hungry, that will be all they're
talking about, so it could be a priority topic. It can be relatively
easy to imitate these, but there should be some contact or push.

People can sometimes imitate a technique simply from hearing about
it, but not always. We could give some probability for doing this on
light contact, but efficient transmission will require more interaction.
Marriage should have some effect as people may learn techniques from
relatives. Residence in the same neighborhood would give ample
opportunities to practice any skills done in public. (Farming would
generally be like that, but certain rituals could be hidden in
buildings!) Clans could also teach each other, or agree to exchange
knowledge.

Let's think again how prestige works and how people make decisions.
(And note that how much prestige to assign to another clan can be
regarded as a basic decision type.) We might imagine this:

*   There is a certain basic prestige assigned to benevolence,
    strength, beauty, etc., that seems to be present in young
    children before much of any socialization.
*   Throughout life but perhaps especially in childhood, people
    observe what others find prestigious and consciously and
    unconsciously update their prestige judgments to be more
    similar.
*   In reality this can be all be incredibly complicated, with
    people assigning prestige on different things in different
    situations, and so on. Always remember the model is an extreme
    simplification.
*   People can assign prestige on many different bases. It will
    depend on what features are salient in their mental model.
    For example, some cultures have detailed genealogical information
    on everyone and this is very important, while others don't
    even have that information.
*   What exactly are people imitating, the decision output or the
    decision process? In general, it can be either or both, so we
    may have to analyze this for each decision, at least at first.
    *   When people know an entity X by name, they can and often do
        directly imitate others' evaluation of X.
    *   When an attribute is a topic of discussion, people can and
        often do directly imitate others' evaluation of the attribute.
        *   Example: beauty standards and fashions
        *   The salience of the item matters a lot, especially for
            the speed of updating. Thus people acquiring unusually
            salient characteristics (e.g., luxury clothing) may
            speed transmission of certain kinds of information
    *   Imitating an entire decision process is somewhat difficult
        but can be done, especially with more education
    *   Imitiation should have some error: we're playing telephone
        here
    *   Can also have "special facts" about a clan or a relationship.
        E.g., maybe there's a minor skeleton in the closet that not
        everyone knows about, or they have a feature that one clan
        considers especially good but not others.
*   Effect of how much contact people have:
    *   Co-presence creates the strongest synchronizing effect, and
        in general more time together means more synchronization
    *   Thus clans could spend more time with specific other clans
        and synchronize more
    *   If people are only meeting occasionally and exchanging 
        "the news", they can readily learn the most salient things
        about each other but not subtler things:
        *   yes: key facts like seniority
        *   yes: striking or unusual factors (first big house,
            especially beautiful person)
        *   partial: key attributes like size, strength, speech:
            decent chance to observe but not necessarily fully
            informed
        *   no: private property and skills
    *   If people interact somewhat more frequently but don't
        necessarily live together, then they can see easily
        observable attributes and goods clearly. They can also
        exchange some information on skills
    *   People in the same neighborhood can also see public
        production skills

Based on that, what factors influence prestige and how do they work?

TODO -- effect of power on prestige

*   Knowable relationships
    *   Self bias. A clan may have a bias in favor of itself, but it
        doesn't necessarily have to.
    *   Seniority. A clan will tend to think a clan that has been 
        around longer has more knowledge and relationships.
        *   Related: Holy lineage
    *   Trade connections. A clan known to be in business for something
        important tends to be respected
    *   Administrative roles. A clan that runs irrigation systems or
        the like has the presumption of being more capable at management
    *   Famous ancestors
    *   Alliances and relationships
    *   Aura of destiny
*   Highly visible performances and buildings
    *   Feasts
    *   Rituals
        *   Especially if the rituals are effective:
            *   People feel better coming out of them
            *   Good things happen in the world afterward
        *   Includes sacrifices
        *   Includes omens regarding the target clan
        *   Includes charisma of individuals in this generation
        *   Includes construction of religious buildings
    *   Artistic expression
    *   Fashions and foreign styles
    *   Mediation and peacekeeping
    *   Burial monuments
    *   Military success
    *   Military fortifications
    *   Extraction of tribute or submission
*   Easily observable attributes
    *   Size
        *   Size of clan and/or followers
    *   Beauty
    *   Strength
    *   Speech
*   Talked-about attributes
    *   Honor: courage, keeping promises, taking revenge
    *   Loyalty and trustworthiness in alliances
    *   Hospitality to guests
    *   Dignity/composure
    *   Wisdom
    *   Record-keeping ability (genealogy, calendar)
    *   Innovation
    *   Recent success, expansion, and/or growth
*   Observable goods
    *   Housing
    *   Clothes
    *   Other visible wealth
*   Less observable attributes
    *   Production skills
        *   Some are practiced more publicly than others
        *   Superior goods are more prestigious
            *   Jewelry > Decorated pottery > Farm tools
    *   Less visible wealth, e.g., stored food
    *   Rumors and secrets
        *   This can include clans successfully spreading fake rumors
            about themselves in a positive light

In our initial small villages, people will all know each in the village,
and they'll be in similar situations, so their prestige judgments wouldn't
actually be that different; we wouldn't even necessarily have to model
them as different. But we'll have situations where differences could be 
important, so let's see what they are:

*   Kinship bias
*   Differences by age, gender
*   Differences by class
    *   E.g., hippies
*   Differing opinion of an omen, misfortune, victory, defeat
    *   There could be a very impactful omen that people differ on how
        to respond to
        *   Could be different collective action: build wall or not
        *   Could be different ritual action: need a certain sacrifice
*   Differing opinion on foreign contact
*   Saturation
    *   Some people will tire of the common style
*   Gossip/rumors not available to/accepted by everyone
*   Rituals/public events not attended by everyone
*   Production specialization
    *   At some point, farmers should be imitating farmers and fishers
        imitating fishers
    *   The key is to have some salient observable differentiate them,
        and then they start using that observable to match on when
        imitating
*   New conditions call for new virtues
    *   Example: prolonged deprivation could decrease prestige of waste
*   Differences on innovation
    *   When an innovation appears, some people might like it (and
        assign positive prestige), but others might disapprove (negative
        prestige)
    *   Can be technical, lifestyle, moral, etc.
    *   Can be based on how well the innovation turned out
    *   It's not clear we need to worry too much about this just yet

See the associated _t file for a table with some notions on some of
these factors and how well known they might be across different levels
of knowledge. An initial set for seminomads could be:

(H = already have in model; x = no)

*   (H) Marriages
*   (x) Feasts and gifts
*   (h) Rituals, omens, and healing
*   (H) Lineage seniority
*   (x) Ritual and moral purity
*   (h) Rare goods
*   (H) Size
*   (x) Charisma
*   (H) Health and beauty
*   (x) Wisdom
*   (x) Craft products
*   (H) Food production

Let's think about some of these one at a time and see what we come up
with:

*   Marriages
    *   In general, marriages generate prestige, but in the model, most
        clan members always get married, so that by itself is a constant
        factor.
    *   Apparently marriage to more or less prestigious clans is what
        differentiates.
    *   Having some prestige flow back and forth would model this
*   Feasts and gifts
    *   Not in the model yet but is perhaps easier and initially as
        important as rituals
    *   This would initially be reciprocal with clans taking turns giving
        each others feasts
    *   Effects:
        *   Has some cost in labor and/or materials
        *   Generates happiness for attendees
        *   Generates prestige for producers
    *   Clans could give different levels of feasts (could start as
        simple as small and large)
*   Rituals, omens, and healing
    *   These could be handled similarly to feasts and gifts
    *   Results after ritual have major impact on prestige of giver
        *   Risk averse = less likely to
        *   Expectation of results creates individual and collective incentives
    *   Levels of coordination
        *   Minimal -- clan rituals
        *   Temporary leaders -- save time, reduce disputes and errors
            for village rituals
        *   Coordinators -- having more skills and relationships to 
            arrange larger, more complex, specialized events
        *   Institutional -- large scale, established
    *   Scaling factors
        *   Small scale: linear scaling of #interactions
        *   Positive network externalities: diversity, effervescence
        *   Negative network externalities: homogenization, protocol differences
            *   Coordination problems: but specifically addressable by
                coordination mechanisms
    *   Offices and office selection
        *   Dimensions
            *   #officers
                *   Start with 1 per clan
                *   But max 10-15
            *   selection: equality vs merit
                *   Fill offices by merit with penalty for too many
            *   how merit is defined: skill, results, charisma, lineage, etc
            *   relationship of offices: equal prominence vs differential
        *   Consensus required for officer selections at first
            *   Failure of consensus may result in split, bad relations,
                bad ritual quality, etc
            *   TBD - what else can happen, but probably based on precedents
                forming OR events out of resolving disagreements

Idea: Start reworking prestige model, going down the list as stuff people
care about! Adjust and elaborate related model pieces as needed. So first
steps are:

*   Marriages and how those affect relations, prestige, and imitation
*   Feasts and gifts
    *   Empirically, free food > free lecture
    *   Gives a place for surplus production to go
    *   Sensible early prestige differentiator based on production
    *   Should give some sort of meaningful benefit to prestige at
        this point
        *   TBD - what that is
*   Rituals, omens, and healing
    *   Huge topic
    *   Consider starting on the drama side: omens and responses to them
