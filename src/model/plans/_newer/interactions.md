I need to give clans more ways to interact for various reasons:

- more dynamism to the simulation
- create substructure with clans being more or less aligned
  to certain other clans
- create more ways for them to differentiate from each other

I also need to update the production model to be less completely
communal. It seems there could have been some communal activities
when there's lots of work to do, and various levels of sharing,
but not automatic total sharing. This will create differential
production and favor-trading opportunities.

Initial set:

*   marriages
    *   marriage will create relationships among clans
    *   TODO - detail
*   food exchange
    *   retain production in clans by default
    *   create institutions and interactions for exchange
    *   TODO - detail
*   ritual production
    *   start with communal production
    *   offer ability to put on special rituals
    *   also crises and omens
    *   TODO - detail
*   justice
    *   disputes over marriages, abuses, respect, and so on
    *   TODO - detail

## Discussions

### Marriages

This is very complicated and there probably isn't much data. These
societies generally were patrilocal, so our model will assume that
the wife's clan considers themselves to be giving a major gift to
the husband's. We can apply that in various levels of detail, with
payments in prestige, wealth, labor, and so on if we choose. We'll
also say that the men's clans propose and the women's choose.

In order to marry:

*   The clans must have a relationship enabling them to know each 
    other's young members and trusting enough to marry
    *   Neighbors in the same small settlement will
    *   Also to other villages in the cluster
    *   May have to spend to maintain those relationships
    *   May have specific practices like inter-village fairs or
        visiting relatives to create those relationships
    *   Can probably allow far marriages at some cost to explore
        and give gifts, and lower probability of success

*   Marriages must be somewhat spread out, not too concentrated
    with another clan, or else they'll merge
    *   At first we're pretty small scale so we can be pretty
        relaxed about this

Marriages will cause clans to become more aligned with each other.

TODO - say more about alignment and how it plays out over time

### Food exchange

First we need to convert clans back to retaining their own production.
Then we can give them ways to interact:

*   Exchange cereals for fish to improve food variety
    *   Could initially use fixed exchange rate
*   Insurance for crop failures
    *   Have some number of crop failures
    *   Allow relationships where others will help
        *   Mutual relationship, requires effort to keep going
            between crises
        *   Communal relationship, may involve a regular exchange
            of some percentage, may require effort to keep going

### Ritual production

### Justice

## Brainstormed lists

List of basic actions:

- marriage/marriage alliance
- gift exchange
- labor exchange
- trade deal
- shame/gossip against
- ostracism
- raid
- feud
- defensive pact
- predict omen
- collective feast
- collective ritual
- collective infrastructure investment
- mediate dispute

Potential sources of conflict:

- access to natural resources
- management of surpluses and stores
- access to prestige goods
- command over labor
- marriage partners
- prestige: best feasts, gifts, rituals
- authority: whose omens and rituals are paid attention to
- honor: disrepect/disputes
- autonomy: freedom from norms/commands
