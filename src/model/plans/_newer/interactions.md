I need to give clans more ways to interact for various reasons:

- more dynamism to the simulation
- create substructure with clans being more or less aligned
  to certain other clans
- create more ways for them to differentiate from each other

List of basic actions:

- marriage/marriage alliance
- gift exchange
- labor exchange
- trade deal
- shame/gossip against
- ostracism
- raid
- feud
- defensive pact
- predict omen
- collective feast
- collective ritual
- collective infrastructure investment
- mediate dispute

Potential sources of conflict:

- access to natural resources
- management of surpluses and stores
- access to prestige goods
- command over labor
- marriage partners
- prestige: best feasts, gifts, rituals
- authority: whose omens and rituals are paid attention to
- honor: disrepect/disputes
- autonomy: freedom from norms/commands
