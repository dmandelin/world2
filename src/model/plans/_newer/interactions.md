I need to give clans more ways to interact for various reasons:

- more dynamism to the simulation
- create substructure with clans being more or less aligned
  to certain other clans
- create more ways for them to differentiate from each other

I also need to update the production model to be less completely
communal. It seems there could have been some communal activities
when there's lots of work to do, and various levels of sharing,
but not automatic total sharing. This will create differential
production and favor-trading opportunities.

Initial set:

*   marriages
    *   marriage will create relationships among clans
    *   TODO - detail
*   food exchange
    *   retain production in clans by default
    *   create institutions and interactions for exchange
    *   TODO - detail
*   ritual production
    *   start with communal production
    *   offer ability to put on special rituals
    *   also crises and omens
    *   TODO - detail
*   justice
    *   disputes over marriages, abuses, respect, and so on
    *   TODO - detail

## Discussions

### Marriage

### Food exchange

### Ritual production

### Justice

## Brainstormed lists

List of basic actions:

- marriage/marriage alliance
- gift exchange
- labor exchange
- trade deal
- shame/gossip against
- ostracism
- raid
- feud
- defensive pact
- predict omen
- collective feast
- collective ritual
- collective infrastructure investment
- mediate dispute

Potential sources of conflict:

- access to natural resources
- management of surpluses and stores
- access to prestige goods
- command over labor
- marriage partners
- prestige: best feasts, gifts, rituals
- authority: whose omens and rituals are paid attention to
- honor: disrepect/disputes
- autonomy: freedom from norms/commands
