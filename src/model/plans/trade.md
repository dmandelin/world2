# Trade

Let's try to keep it really simple for now.

## Inter-village trade

We'll assume that all trade goods are more or less accessible
within a cluster, so inter-village trade is modeled implicitly.
For now, we'll assume that it's fairly minor impact, and give
a small TFP bonus up to 7 villages or so.

## Inter-cluster trade

## Off-map trade
