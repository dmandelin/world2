# Social changes

Here is a list of candidate social changes to introduce for the
period 6500-5500 BC. Each has some codes:

*    Approximate date of first appearance
*    123 - level of real-world attestation, 1 is most
*    ABC - how readily adopted

The changes:

*    (P1) 6500 1B - Permanent settlements
*    (P1) 6500 1A - Intensive marshland economy
*    (P2) 6500 2B - Clay tokens
*    (P1) 6500 1A - Ophidian clay figurines
*    (P1) 6200 2B - Canal irrigation
*    (P3) 6200 2A - Barley focus
*    (P2) 6000 1A - Specialized pottery production
*    (P3) 5800 1A - Clay sickles
*    (P2) 5800 1A - Tripartite house
*    (P1) 5750 1B - Community shrine buildings
*    (P2) 5750 2B - Long-distance exchange
*    (P3) 5500 2A - Ritual feasting
*    (P2) 5500 2C - Leadership roles
*    (P3) 5500 1B - Extramural cemeteries

Details:

*   Permanent settlements

    *   Start with shifting settlements
    *   Ditching technology and investment allow switching to permanent settlement
    
    *   People have the idea of ditching, but might need time to build up ditching
        skills in the new environment
    *   There could also be some risk, especially if there is not yet a lot of
        experience with ditching
    *   Decisions:
        
        *   Ditch shifting settlement -- increases expected time to move, but some
            chance it will not and effort was wasted
        *   Establish permanent settlement -- increases expected time to move even
            more, but still no guarantees

    *   At first, the only effect of moving less often is QoL, but it should probably
        be a precondition for many future developments

    *   Implementation

        *   Add an irrigation skill
        *   Clans can decide to work on ditches or not but all get the benefit
            *   Clans can shame shirkers resulting in a QoL penalty, but that's it
        *   Clans can decide to settle permanently or not
            *   Village splits if some go each way
            *   Permanence is an attribute of the settlement
        *   Keep in mind that these are all actually iterated prisoners' dilemmas
            inside each 20-year turn. If someone defects, they can collect on that
            only one time out of many notional steps inside the turn. Real defection
            is probably more of a long-term policy shift that other clans don't like,
            but we can definitely imagine ill-advised short defections as background
            friction if we need it.

*   Marshland economy

    *   Add a farmer/fisher trait, allow learning and assimilation
    *   Make both variable production but on different bases
    *   Fishing less dependent on stationary settlements
     
*   Ophidian clay figurines

    *   Requires trade connection or developing artisan skill
    *   Boosts ritual production

*   Canal irrigation
    *   Level 1: small irrigation works to modestly expand arable land
    *   Level 2: larger irrigation works requiring more people to maintain

*   Shrine buildings

    *   Some investment to build but not that high
    *   New ritual allowing more ritual production
