We start thinking of communal rituals where every clan
participates more or less equally, and consider what problems
people might have with their rituals and how they might
choose to solve them.

There are many cases where this issue comes up, including
extended-family holiday get-togethers, so we can draw
inspiration from all of that.

## Problem: low ritual skill by one clan

A single clan with low ritual skill drags down the entire
ritual. Think of a relative who makes very inappropriate
remarks, or performs a key ritual badly (making a very bad
turkey).

How have people dealt with this?

Within common rituals:

*   Pressure release: light mocking to call out issue without
    really doing much -or- attributing issues to gods or the
    community as a whole
*   Informal policing: reactions in the moment, ad hoc 
    negotiations
*   Individual rules: rules that a certain person or clan
    has follow, typically temporary to the issue
*   Individual/individuals leadership: appoint certain people
    to take charge, typically temporary to the issue
*   Modify ritual: especially deleting problematic components.
*   Socialization: practices to teach new community members
    better how to act
*   Shunning: a more formal, intensive version of informal
    policing
*   Exit: the low-ritual-skill people may leave
*   Narrative: narrative elements to remind people of how to
    act.

With different ritual structures:

*   Initiation: can be variously broad and narrow filters
    correlated with skill.
*   Different roles: drumming, cooking, etc. Low-skill clans
    can be given less influential roles.
*   Architecture/ritual dress: different places to be

## Problem: low ritual skill of all clans

There have also been villages where every clan had low ritual
skill so rituals were poor.

Dealing with this in common rituals:

*   Release: mockery, acceptance, etc.
*   Look for new information: look for people, written sources,
    etc., who can give ideas how to do it better.
*   Initiative: someone decides to try something substantially
    different, e.g., intensification
*   Repetition: repeat the forms exactly to try to be better

## Problems of large scale

In the initial model, rituals become lower quality as scale
goes up, but this was abstracted behind a quality curve.

First, actual reasons rituals get less good with too big scale:

*   Lower participation ratio: harder for individuals to feel
    seen by community, have meaningful interactions across clans
*   Interruptions: side conversations and random logistical needs
    (e.g., more people needing bathroom) complicates things.
*   Logistics: getting the quantity of food together, finding
    space for people, etc., gets hard
*   Divergent norms: different expectations for how to do it
    This also causes symbols to have their meaning fragment or
    decline, or myths to become confused
*   Choreographic breakdown: dances or call-and-response rituals
    get hard to perform in sync, variability of performances rises
*   Status competition: groups may start to compete for status,
    e.g., competition in other domains such as economics or
    prestige can bleed over into rituals
*   Training confusion: hard to understand whom to learn from

Attempted solutions:

*   Break up into smaller groups
*   Segmented activities (e.g., kids table) to simplify logistics
    and contain interruptions
*   Assigned roles to simplify coordination
*   Standardization: less change in ritual year to year
*   Core/audience split: reduce major participation to manageable
    number
*   Emergent leadership: someone is able to take charge informally
*   Accepting "elders" having more influence
*   Filtering: initiation
*   Sacralization: punishments for failure
*   Spatial design
*   Variable symbols: symbols where there can be a stable core but
    space for variation around it

## Problems of small scale

*   Not an event: not different enough from everyday life
*   Not enough energy: people not reflecting off each other enough,
    things falling flat, increase pressure on individuals
*   Reduced diversity and specialization: not enough cool stuff
    different people could be noted for
*   Loss of knowledge: not enough people to remember how to do
    everything
*   Domination: single member could dominate, go unchecked
*   Cultural belief: people may believe a certain number are
    necessary for the ritual to work
*   Ritual structure: not enough people to fill offices

Dealing with too few people:

*   Symbolic stand-ins: pour one out for the fallen, etc.
*   Adapt ritual: make it intentionally smaller, more intimate
*   Suspension: don't do all the ritual but plan to revive later
*   Fuse/recruit: get more people

## Some key dynamics

Parable of the talents: those who have bigger roles will tend
to gain ritual skill faster.

Preferred scales:
- Contemporary extended-family holidays: 5-50 (best 8-25)
  - too few isn't a special event
  - too many makes logistics and preferences hard
- Modern egalitarian religious communities: 12-40 (best 8-80)
  - too few means too little spiritual energy, too little
    role rotation, too few perspectives
  - too many brings diffusion of responsibility and reluctance
    to speak (or difficulty being heard)
- Anthropologically studied groups: 30-80 (best 10-150)
  - too few means can't fill roles, can't represent all tribes
  - too big means coordination difficulty, status competition,
    confusion (people can't see the whole ritual, tell what's
    going on)

Note that those scales are for the number of people actually
in the ritual, which varies (noting that small babies for
example are not going to dancing):
- Egalitarian (including gender) groups: 50% (30-70% or even 80%)
  - 20-30% may speak more
- Gendered: 10-25% main participation but women might have
  support roles
- Ranked (gendered or not): 10-40%
- Priestly: 5-15%, others may support

## Role differentiation

Even at small scales there can be different roles (listing
failure risk, prestige reward, and skill required)

- [HHH] Lead invocation
- [LMM] Food and drink
- [MMH] Dance, movement, and music
- [M(M/H)] Object preparation
- [LLL] Audience presence

Mechanisms for reducing the risk of power accumulation by
specialists:

*   Mockery (can be culturally systematized)
*   Turn-taking in ritual roles
*   Saturation: same stuff over and over isn't that impressive
*   Consensus norms: expectations of consensus decisions
*   Limited role scope: culture explicitly scopes roles of
    ritual leaders
*   Humility doctrines: leaders not claiming too much power, may
    claim to represent traditions or gods

## Starting state

For our initial starting state in the Ubaid period, communities
were small (50-150 people). They did have some apparent ritual
architectural differentiation: some larger buildings that appear
to be common spaces of some sort.

It's believed that some people had more influence in rituals:
- Elders
- People with evident greater ritual skill
- Clans with greater ritual knowledge, seniority
- Clans in possession of key ritual objects

We'll assume that it's culturally accepted and expected for
those people to have a greater role in rituals, and similar
for public assemblies, and that this gains prestige but doesn't
have automatic further effects.

We can probably also assume:
*   some sort of taboos or rules exist (which probably get
    more elaborate over time)
*   some sort of emergent leadership exists: people step up
    when needed or are recognized, but without expectation of
    continuity or role change outside the rituals
*   possibly already practices of appointing temporary leaders
    to help with the ritual; seems common at this level of
    development
*   some narratives -- if it's already a developed
    agricultural society, they were probably worshiping
    a cereal goddess and possibly others, but maybe simple
    at this point
*   symbolic stand-ins -- people probably had ancestors and
    deities effectively present at rituals (strengthening
    over time via statues etc)
*   some sort of community space -- a bigger space or building
    in the village. Unclear how divided between civic, social,
    and ritual, but likely of some ritual usage.
*   some level of traveling to visit relatives elsewhere, pick
    up new ideas, etc., with influence on rituals
*   people and communities making various choices about when
    to vary rituals more and when to lock them down less;
    presumably at this point it's generally fluid with no
    strong tendency either way
*   not much core/audience split at first: probably most
    adults participating in some way
*   unclear sacralization: later Sumer seems to have featured
    expectations of punishments for getting rituals wrong, so
    it's possible some piece of this was starting, in a 
    community way
*   unclear socialization/education processes: not clear what
    they were doing at first, but maybe fairly organic with
    children joining rituals at certain points -- so something
    probably existed, but integrated with society and not
    otherwise separated and formalized
*   variable symbology: it seems this was probably important,
    but maybe more at the bigger scales later on, e.g., develop a pottery style that can be widely imitated, yet
    locally varied, to balance individuality and connection.

Gender: It's unclear if there's an initial status difference,
but there probably was at least differentiation, e.g., women-
only pregnancy rituals.

## State shifts from starting

The really important thing for the model is what shifts we can
have from the starting state. One will be ritual elaborations
and new practices. But in terms of the items above:

Coded to call out a few that will help with certain issues:
-   S: skill spread among clans
-   L: general low skill
-   N: scale

Also add priorities to try to call out a few items in each
category.

*   [SLN; P1.6] Elaboration of basic ritual (dance, food, etc)
*   [SLN] Narrative developments: to remind people how to act,
    support ritual practices

*   [L; P1.4] Initiative: vary harder to try to improve skill
*   [L; P1.3] Looking for more information, travel, etc

*   [SN] Leadership
    * [S; P1.2] more authority for offices 
    * [S; P1.1] more skill concentration for offices
    * [S] inherited
    * [S] restricted by training
    * [S] full-time instead of part time
    * [SN] more symbology
    * more control over temple resources

*   [SN] Core/audience split starts up
    * [SN; P1.5] restrict participation to original size
           probably implies other modifications
*   [SN; P2] Architecture: bigger spaces, more split off from other uses
*   [SN] Sacralization: increasing

*   [N] Variable symbology: more
*   [N] Symbolic stand-ins: more
*   [N] Adapt rituals to deal with scaling issues
*   [N] Institutionalization
    * standardization of various stuff
    * rebuilding temples in the same way
    * more types of institutional buildings/infra

*   Socialization practices
    * possible lineage-specific training
    * possible apprenticeship
*   Power
    * starting to somehow gain control over trade routes,
      canals, or storage
    * corvee labor, economic taxation
    * family rank
