# Culture: outline of basic concepts

## Definition and structure

Each clan or primary entity has a **culture**, which is
a vector of boolean and floating traits, for example:

*   boolean for use of a certain technology or new style
*   floats for % of hunter-gatherer and farmer culture
*   float for % and strength of unique cultural traits

These traits can be anything that people can differ on
that matters.

## Distance between cultures

A cultural distance can be defined as a normalized inner
product on between two cultures. This can be used for
various things, such as ease of relationships or learning.

## Culture change

A clan's culture changes in two ways:

*   becoming more similar to the average of other clans
    it communicates with, weighted by prestige and
    similarity
*   innovating in some way, either learning from a far
    source, inventing a new cultural dimension, or making
    a "random" change

## Identity

At first there isn't a distinct sense of identity beyond
"our clan/village" and "the others". But when there are
visibly different distinct clusters of cultures in
communication, there can be invented names and thus
identities. Identities and their aspects then also become
cultural traits.
