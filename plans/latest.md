The current theme is to give clans more personality and interactions.

# Motivations

Clans are motivated to get:

*   Survival necessities
*   Belonging - being accepted, liked, having allies
*   Prestige - being considered important, valuable, competent
*   Luxury - comfort, pleasure
*   Power/Liberty - agency, freedom, ability
*   Meaning - ritual, meaning, sacredness

Clans and leaders may weight these differently, by personality.

In general, clans stick to established habits, but if one of these
motivators is below their their target, they'll be motivated to
change, with the intensity of motivation depending on gap and
criticality. On targets:

*   Survival targets are mostly fixed
*   Other targets by default change to match clan's expectation
    of what's possible for them
*   In some cases, clans may develop new targets, for example based
    on a prophetic dream

# Events and Actions

Clans can take actions according to their motivations. These can
either be standard actions, or actions prompted by events.

Brainstormed action list:

*   Improve flood control systems
*   Establish new farm via small canal
*   Provide sick care
*   Share food (e.g., in response to crop failure)
*   Hold better feasts
*   Build houses
*   Build storehouse
*   Offer compensation (e.g, for tort)
*   Accept blame
*   Cast blame (falsely or truly)
*   Spread rumors
*   Provide aid (after accident)
*   Give gifts (e.g., decorative objects)
*   Organize larger communal work project
*   Demonstrate exceptional skill (arts, performances)
*   Innovate a tool or production technique
*   Found a new hamlet
*   Take leadership in a crisis (organize responses, rituals)
*   Assert a claim on land or to a scarce resource
*   Assert special holy status
*   Perform better rituals
*   Fund rituals
*   Perform crisis ritual
*   Challenge ritual leader
*   Exclude others from rituals
*   Gift luxury goods/performances
*   Display luxuries (clothes, dwellings)
*   Innovate luxury style
*   Practice skills
*   Innovate techniques
*   Explore wilderness
*   Visit far-off people
*   Dream quest
*   Establish trade relationship
*   Exploit bumper crop
*   Respond to visitors arriving
*   Respond to newly discovered resource
*   Immigrants
*   Expel troublemakers

# Where to go next

Let's try to make this all quite visible:

*   Prominent UI to show exactly where clans are on the motivators
    *   Current status
    *   Target
    *   Differential and motivational level
    *   Colors/visuals to make things more obvious
*   Give clans personalities, can keep it simple at first with a
    list of types
*   Give clans leaders, with a leadership quality value and a leader
    personality
*   Give clans the ability to perform one special action or a small
    number of special actions per turn
*   Consider giving clans a "stance" to model the level of cooperation
    *   Options like:
        *   Give to whomever asks
        *   Give to those we know
        *   Give to those in need
    
Some key events and actions:

*   Host/participate
    *   Hold feasts and participate in rituals in the normal way
        *   Also have options for higher and lower levels
    *   Clans must choose who they'll host, and there's a cost for each
        *   Thus at some point they can't do this with everyone
    *   Relatedness and prestige boost
        *   But the boost depends on what else they are receiving
    *   This is a place different logics of cooperation could be used:
        *   Communal sharing - Participation doesn't necessarily cost
            anything, as long as you belong.
        *   Ranked authority - There are explicitly defined classes to
            participate in, with different costs and benefits.
        *   Equal turns - Everyone pays the same cost in order to be
            allowed to participate.
        *   Market pricing - People participate as much as they want
            and get that much reputation.
*   Floods and crop failures
    *   Might severely affect ~1 clan per village in a typical turn
        *   On their own: reduced happiness, population growth
        *   With help: smaller effects
*   Bumper crops
    *   Might happen for ~1 clan per village in a typical turn, but
        sometimes the whole village
    *   Creates opportunity to take special actions:
        *   Help someone else more easily and better in case of crop failure
        *   Throw extra-large feasts (longer-term reputation bonus)
        *   Fund bigger labor project
        *   Trade for other goods
